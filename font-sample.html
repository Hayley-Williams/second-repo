    <p class="one font-effect-neon">Don't overuse Peridex</p>
    <p class="copy"> After having a oral surgery in January, I was prescribed Peridex.
      Peridex is a germicidal mouthwash that reduces bacteria in the mouth and is often
      prescribed following surgery to prevent infections. Well, it turns out
      I'm one of those patients dentists, phramacists, and doctors hate. I didn't
      read the detailed instructions that came with my bottle of mouthwash. <br>One day, I looked into my mouth 
      after flossing and was confused to find many stains! Have I been brushing with coffee for the past month?
      That's when I discovered Peridex with stain you teeth.
      And the best part that the CDC has urged dentist offices to not open until summer, at the earliest. 
      So when you tell me I have a popcorn kernel stuck in my mouth, I'll correct you and say
      no, it's not a popcorn kernel. It's regret. The bitter taste of regret stained in my mouth!
      So kids... Please don't be an idiot! Read your presecription directions. Ah I'm tired. I hope no one reads this.</p>
