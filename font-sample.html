    <p class="one font-effect-neon">Don't overuse Peridex</p>
    <p class="copy"> After having a oral surgery in January, I was prescribed Peridex.
      Peridex is a germicidal mouthwash that reduces bacteria in the mouth and is often
      prescribed following surgery to prevent infections. Well, it turns out
      I'm one of those patients dentists, phramacists, and doctors hate. I didn't
      read the detailed instructions that came with my bottle of mouthwash. I used it
      beyond my one-week presciption because, hey I paid for this bottle of mouthwash for I'm
      going to use it. Lo and behold, I looked into my mouth one day after flossing
      and was confused to find a bunch of chocolate in between my teeth! Except it wasn't chocolate...
      they were stains! Have I been brushing with coffee in place of toothpaste for the past month?
      That's when I read the instructions and discovered Peridex with stain you teeth.
      And the best part that the CDC has urged dentist offices to close until summer, at the shortest. 
      So when my boyfrend tells me I have a popcorn kernel stuck in my mouth, I'll correct him and say
      no, it's not a popcorn kernel. It's regret. The bitter taste of regret stained in my mouth.
      So kids! Please don't be an idiot and read your presecription directions. Ah I'm tired. I hope no one reads this.</p>
